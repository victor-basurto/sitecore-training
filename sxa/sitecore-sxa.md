### SXA Project Workflow
- Define
    : ask yourself Why do you want to spend money on creating a new website? What is the ultimate goal of your site? to support you in determining how you are going to use `SXA`, and what `KPIs` need to be defined to measure success
    Then, your team will need to consider both the content and styling of your site.
        - What types of content can be shared?
            : Sitecore recommends sharing content across your site, and **SXA** lets you share `styles`, `data sources`, `page designs`, `partials designs` and `rendering variants` between te sites within one tenant.
        - Are you considering a multilingual implementation?
            : If so, you can plan to use a default script and the **SXA** language manager to deliver your **SXA** site in a different language version.

- Design
    : 1- Default renderings and the ability to define `rendering variants`
    2- _Out-of-the-Box_ Components
    3- Component Cloning. A cloned component will give you an exact copy of the `rendering definition item`, `rendering parameters template`, `datasource templates`, and `branches`.
    4- Plan for custom components in more complex solutions

- Analyze
    : First the team will need to complete a gap analysis between your completed design and what is provided with **SXA's** _out-of-the-box_ toolset. Make sure to map the design alongside the _out-of-the-box_ components.

- Implement
    : - Content Entry
        : as soon as a page design has been implemented, start entering the content for your site.
    : - Front-end Development
        : As layouts and rendering are completed, work on static exports of the `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` or work on your source repository-controlled `CSS` and `JS` files or `sync` directly with the **SXA** solution.

- _Sitecore Experience Accelerator separates structure from design, so your team can deploy and maintain multiple sites quickly and cost-effectively._

**True or false: Web development teams use SXA to reduce team size and eliminate the need for back-end Developers during the website production process.**
